# personal-project-manager
## What is PersonalProjectManager?
A Java application that lets one keep track of projects and tasks, such as study projects or programming endeavours, log time spent with specific tasks and see indicators based on the stored data. The project's main purpose was to be used with a project tracker database that help one keep track of their time spent working on personal projects and studies.
## Functionality
- Log in to any Microsoft SQL Server instance by using SQL Server Authentication.
- Dynamically load existing tables in the given database.
- Open an editor and perform INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements.
- Open any predefined views within the database and check the result set.
## Used Technologies
- Java
- JDBC for database connectivity
- Microsoft SQL Server and T-SQL for the database
- JavaFX for the native Java graphical user interface
## Future development ideas
- Currently the database server login information is stored as plain text, which is far from ideal, but for my personal use on a locally hosted database instance this was sufficient. Nevertheless, using hashing and salting would be strongly advised.
- Adding a custom SQL script window for writing queries manually would be a great addition to the application.
